 * If you have downloaded the book's source code from www.pearsonhighered.com/gaddis,
 * you will find a partially written program named AreaRectangle.java in the
 * chapter's source code folder. Your job is to complete the program. When it is
 * complete, the program will ask the user to enter the width and length of a
 * rectangle, and then display the rectangle's area. The program calls the
 * following methods, which have not been written:
 * 
 *      getLength - This method should ask the user to enter the rectangle's
 *      length, and then return that value as a double.
 *      getWidth - This method should ask the user to enter the rectangle's
 *      width, and then return that value as a double.
 *      getArea - This method should accept the rectangle's length and width
 *      as arguments, and return the rectangle's area. The area is calculated
 *      by multiplying the length by the width.
 *      displayData - This method should accept the rectangle's length, width,
 *      and area as arguments, and display theml in an appropriate message
 *      on the screen.
